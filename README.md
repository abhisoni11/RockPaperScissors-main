# C# Programming Challenge: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

### Game Rules:

This program will allow the user to play a series of rock, paper, scissors games. 
A match takes place between 2 players and is made up of 3 games, with the overall winner being the first player to win 2 games (i.e. best of 3)
Each game consists of both players selecting one of Rock, Paper or Scissors; the game winner is determined based on the following rules:
1. Rock beats scissors
2. Scissors beats paper
3. Paper beats rock

### Assumptions:

Code is written in c# and can compile in Visual Studio 20xx (whatever version you have access too). 
Tests should be written in NUnit or MSTest and MOQ for Mocking

There is no need for any sophisticated UI a console application will do.

### Requirement:

Your application must support two types of player:

1. Human Player
The user must be prompted for a selection of Rock, Paper or Scissors for each turn

2. Random Computer Player
The random computer player should automatically select one of Rock, Paper or Scissors at 

You should supply unit tests with your solution.  You may use any unit testing framework/mocking framework with which you are comfortable.

### The test will be evaluated based on the code being:

1. Clean and simple code
2. Good OO design (SOLID)
3. Good test coverage and ideally driven from tests (TDD)
4. Code should be able to extensions without rework
